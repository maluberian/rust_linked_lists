# Description
This repo contains work done in an effort to become adept at Rust development
This work comes from the [Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists](https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/index.html)
tutorial. The idea is to learn ownership, lifetimes, etc. by developing
list implementations.
